DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK:
Task Description: Quiz Application

This project involves creating a **Quiz Application** that allows users to select a domain and answer multiple-choice questions based on the domain. The application will dynamically load questions, track users’ progress, and display results at the end of the quiz. Here's a breakdown of the features and workflow:

1. **Domain Selection**: 
   - The quiz starts with the user selecting a domain from a dropdown menu. Domains could include categories such as **Science**, **History**, **Geography**, **Mathematics**, and **Technology**.
   - Based on the domain selected, a set of questions related to that domain will be presented to the user.

2. **Question Display**: 
   - For each selected domain, the quiz will present one question at a time. Each question will have a set of multiple-choice options.
   - The user will click on an option to select their answer, and once an option is selected, the "Confirm Answer" button will become active, allowing the user to confirm their choice.

3. **Answer Validation and Feedback**: 
   - After the user confirms their answer, the application will check whether the answer is correct or incorrect.
   - Feedback is provided immediately after the answer is confirmed, including whether the answer was correct, and if not, the correct answer will be displayed.

4. **Progress Tracking**: 
   - The quiz will show a **progress bar** at the bottom of the screen to visualize the user’s progress through the quiz.
   - The bar will fill up as the user answers each question, giving them a sense of completion.

5. **Navigation**: 
   - Once a question is answered, the user can click the "Next" button to proceed to the next question.
   - After answering all the questions in the domain, a summary of the quiz results will be shown, including the score out of the total number of questions.
   - The user will also be able to return to the domain selection screen by clicking the "Return" button.

6. **User Interface and Design**:
   - The quiz has a clean, minimalist design that is easy to navigate. The questions, options, and results are centrally aligned for better readability.
   - Buttons are styled with CSS to ensure a user-friendly experience, with visual feedback for selected and confirmed answers.
   - A responsive layout ensures that the application works on various screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

7. **Score Tracking**:
   - The user’s score is tracked throughout the quiz. Each correct answer increases the score, and at the end of the quiz, the score is displayed along with the total number of questions in that domain.
   - The scores are stored temporarily within the session and can be displayed as a summary after completing the quiz.

This Quiz Application is ideal for learning and self-assessment, enabling users to test their knowledge across multiple domains. It is a great tool for students, educators, or anyone looking to challenge themselves on various topics. Additionally, the application can be further extended to support features like saving progress, reviewing incorrect answers, and adding more question domains.
